  <!--About the website (idea behind it)-->
  <h2> About </h2>
  <p> This website idea stemmed from myself, Lydia Adejumo. I consider myself to be quite indecisive for some not so important issues like decising on a restaurant to go to or a new phone. This method of deciding has been tried and tested; proving to a very helpful method.</p>
  <p> Hopefully this website will be useful to all other not so decisive individuals, here to help you make a rational decision.</p>
  <p> Enjoy </p>
