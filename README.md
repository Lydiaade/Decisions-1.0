# Decisions 1.0

This project was created as a first interaction with Python as a Code First Girl. It has over the years developed as the libraries have evolved and as my knowledge of Python has grown.


### Technology Changes
This application was originally created in Python 2 and has since been updated to Python 3


### Run Application
To run the application please set up your local environment using the `local-venv-setup-sh` file. After this please run the following commands

```commandline
export FLASK_APP=Home.py
flask run  
```

An alternative is to run the application directly from the application which can run from `app/Home.py`
